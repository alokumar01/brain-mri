## 📝 Project Overview

**Brain MRI Analysis** is a full-stack academic project designed to demonstrate how modern web technologies and Python scripting can simulate AI-powered MRI scan analysis. It uses **dummy data** and mock AI logic to generate analysis results and patient reports.

Built using the **MENN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, Next.js) along with **Python** for generating PDF reports and producing **dummy AI-generated** analysis, this project is a conceptual representation of healthcare software for educational purposes only.

## 🧠 AI Analysis (Dummy)

The AI component in this project is entirely **dummy/simulated**. Python scripts are used to randomly generate:

- Fake medical findings
- Simulated anomaly detection (e.g., tumors, lesions)
- Probability scores and diagnostic summaries
- Text-based recommendations

No real AI models or datasets are used. The purpose is purely to simulate how such systems *could* work in a real-world setting.

## 📄 PDF Report Generation (Dummy Data)

PDF reports are created using Python and include **dummy patient details** and **simulated diagnostic results** such as:

- Patient name, ID (mock)
- Scan date (auto-filled)
- Dummy AI findings
- Fake medical recommendations

These PDFs mimic real medical reports for presentation purposes.
